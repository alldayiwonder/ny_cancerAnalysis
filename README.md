# Analysis of Cancer Incidence Rates in New York State
Cancer is one of the most common chronic diseases in New York State, and is second only to heart disease as the leading cause of death. Each year, about 100,000 New Yorkers are diagnosed with cancer. This project aims to study the relationship between cancer incidence rates and various features, with a focus on industrial air pollution in New York State.  

## Smoking
Smoking is a risk factor for cancers of the lung, mouth, larynx, bladder, kidney, and several other organs. But having a risk factor, or even several, does not mean that you will get the disease. We use data that estimates the number of smokers in each area to control for smoking. The table below indicates whether smoking is the highest risk factor for each cancer type.

## Cancers analyzed and risk factors:
The below information was taken from the American Cancer Society and other literature.

| Cancer Type  | Smoking | Industrial Chemicals | Industries |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bladder  | Highest | o-Toluidine, analine, benzidine, beta-naphthylamine | rubber, leather, textiles, paint products, printing |
| Bone  |   |
| Brain  |   | vinyl chloride | plastics |
| Breast  |   |
| Colorectal  |   |
| Esophagus  |   |
| Kidney  | High |
| Larynx  | High | wood dust, paint fumes  | metalworking, petroleum, plastics, textile
| Leukemia  |   | benzene | rubber, oil refining, gasoline-related industries, chemical manufacturing, shoe manufacturing |
| Liver  | | vinyl chloride |
| Lung  | High | arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, silica, vinyl chloride, nickel compounds, chromium compounds, coal products, mustard gas, chloromethyl ethers |
| Mesothelioma  |  |
| NHL  |   |
| Nasal  |   |
| Oral  |   |
| Other  |   |
| Ovary  |   |
| Pancreas  |   |   | metal refining
| Prostate  |   |
| Soft_Tissue  |   |
| Stomach  |   |
| Testis  |   |
| Thyroid  |   |
| Uterus  |   |

Notes:

* For brain cancer: exposure to vinyl chloride (a chemical used to manufacture plastics), petroleum products, and certain other chemicals have been linked with an increased risk of brain tumors in some studies but not in others.
* For leukemia: chemical exposure is more strongly linked to an increased risk of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) than to other forms of leukemia.
